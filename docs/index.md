# Jira Cloud Provider

Working in Operations engineering organizations infrastructure is often driven by tickets. 
Why not track infrastructure using tickets but this time we will use code. 

## Example Usage

Set Jira Cloud instance URL, Username and API-Token using environment variables

```bash
export JIRA_URL=https://yourinstance.atlassian.net
export JIRA_USER=username@example.org
export JIRA_PASSWORD=<API-Key>
```

```terraform
provider "jira" {
  url      = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net" # Can also be set using the JIRA_URL environment variable
  user     = "xxxx"                               # Can also be set using the JIRA_USER environment variable
  password = "xxxx"                               # Can also be set using the JIRA_PASSWORD environment variable
}
```
