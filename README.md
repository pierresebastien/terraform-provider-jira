Terraform Provider for managing Jira Cloud. (__[View on registry.terraform.io](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/pierresebastien/jira/latest)__)

## Data Sources

- Issue Keys from JQL
- Custom Fields

## Resources

- Comments
- Components
- Filters & Filter Permissions
- Groups
- Group Memberships
- Issues
- Issue Links
- Issue Types
- Issue Link Types
- Projects
- Project Categories
- Project Roles
- Roles
- Users
- Webhooks

This can be used to interlink infrastructure management with JIRA issues closely.

## Known issues

Resources involving users may not works correctly because the provider was originally intend to works with username but this is not possible anymore because the API expect to receive the account id. More information : https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/deprecation-notice-user-privacy-api-migration-guide/

## Install

## Terraform v0.13 or newer

Copy this code into yout terraform configuration file (for example `main.tf`)

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    jira = {
      source = "pierresebastien/jira-cloud"
      version = "0.1.0"
    }
  }
}
```

Run `terraform init`

## Example Usage

Set Jira Cloud instance URL, Username and API-Token using environment variables

```bash
export JIRA_URL=https://yourinstance.atlassian.net
export JIRA_USER=username@example.org
export JIRA_PASSWORD=<API-Key>
```

Create terraform config file

```hcl

provider "jira" {
  url = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net" # Can also be set using the JIRA_URL environment variable
  # user = "xxxx"                      # Can also be set using the JIRA_USER environment variable
  # password = "xxxx"                  # Can also be set using the JIRA_PASSWORD environment variable
}

```bash

Initializing provider plugins...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

Run `terraform plan`

```bash
terraform plan
```

Check if the terraform plan looks good

Run `terraform apply`

```bash
terraform apply
```

## Building 

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine.

*Note:* This project uses [Go Modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) making it safe to work with it outside of your existing [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH). The instructions that follow assume a directory in your home directory outside of the standard GOPATH (i.e `$HOME/development/terraform-providers/`).

Clone repository to: `$HOME/development/terraform-providers/`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $HOME/development/terraform-providers/; cd $HOME/development/terraform-providers/
$ git clone git@github.com:pierresebastien/terraform-provider-jira
...
```

Enter the provider directory and run `make build` to build the provider

```sh
$ make build
```
